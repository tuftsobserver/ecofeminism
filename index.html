                    The issue with “women’s issues,” whether we’re talking about the fight for contraceptive coverage or universal paid maternity leave, is that as they become classified as such, they lose a sense of validity and urgency, becoming, instead, issues rooted in sentimentality and sighs of “well, wouldn’t that be nice.”
                </p>
                <p>
                    I often find myself in a chicken-and-egg cycle of thinking: Do these become women’s issues because they are already the forgotten overflow of ubiquitous masculine bias, ideas fallen to the wayside to focus instead on matters of national security and building society onward and upwards? Or do they fall to the wayside because they were women’s issues to begin with? Meanwhile, environmentalism is rising slowly but surely to be amongst the preeminent buzzwords of the modern political and social conversation. While it finally seems that people—and not just those who are most immediately affected by the degradation of the planet—are starting to place importance on preservation and sustainability, I still can’t help but think that the latter, rather than the former, is the case.
                </p>
                <p>
                    It often seems to me that the environment is becoming an important backic because men are getting involved, and likewise, because “saving the planet” is becoming profitable. In Engendering Environmental Thinking: A Feminist Analysis of the Present Crisis, ecofeminist Ruth Perry names the motivation of profit to blame for society's disregard of the earth’s natural systems: “Short term-gains for individuals—so long as they are the kind of profits that show up on the balance sheets of the present accounting system—matter more than infinitely renewable gains in the quality of air and water and regional biodiversity… What is not paid for is not valued in our culture.”

            <p>
                This division between the paid-for and the not-paid-for, the “work of production” and the “work of reproducing the conditions for life,” as Perry calls them, aligns with and is fortified by a gender divide. Speaking of industrialization as a driving force for the rise of wage labor, Perry claims that what has historically been regarded as “man’s work” in the “formal economy” derives meaning “precisely from its being disconnected from private domestic life.”
            </p>
            <p>
                The separation between the “formal economy” and the “private domestic life” becomes apparent when one observes how many fields seemingly cannot exist in both spheres. Take, for example, medicine: midwives were predominantly responsible for aiding in childbirth until the 18th century, at which point childbirth became systematized and commodified. It became the work of (mostly male) doctors in for-profit hospitals, leaving midwifery in the past as a form of “alternative medicine.” Other similar collections of knowledge often fall into the same pattern of devaluation and then, appropriation. The encapsulation of herbal remedies as being derived from “old wives’ tales” serves a greater purpose than to make them easier to swallow. This process of appropriation makes them more accessible for consumers—easier to quantify, easier to bottle up and distribute, and easier to legitimize via the purchasing power of consumers.
            </p>
            <p>
                As a result of this pattern of opportunistic commodification, fields such as environmental engineering and entrepreneurial efforts in “green energy” and biofuels are becoming hot-ticket career paths, while invaluable, more home-grown sustainable efforts, such as lifestyle choices and local grassroots organizing remain in the background. For example, according to toprntobsn.com, 59 percent of vegetarians and 79 percent of vegans are women.  Likewise, when we are unable to put a price tag on knowledge and practices derived from work in the private domestic sphere, they remain unvalued. While this is undoubtedly a symptom of a society that is built upon a for-profit system, it remains a cause for anxiety that these knowledges and practices that have historically belonged to women are becoming part of the “formal economy.” Given the disparities that exist in systems of education, employment, and entrepreneurship, it is clear that the commodification of informal, female-centric practices will not function to benefit (or profit) women, but rather will be neatly appropriated by men.

                The arrival of men in the conversation of environmentalism is also cause for justifiable concern over the delegitimization of “the personal” in the context of politics. That is, anecdotal accounts of issues are often disregarded in favor of quantifiable, “objective” facts, so much so that personal attachment to a situation works to devalue one’s testimony. An extensive history of women delegated to the domestic sphere by the constructs of patriarchal society have spearheaded an impressive timeline of environmental activism. Perhaps it was prompted by their traditional role of family caretaking and frontline observations of environmental degradation that tends to disproportionately harm women and children. The term “tree hugger” itself stems from the Chipko movement in India in the 1970s, in which women would stand in front of trees to prevent their being cut down for purposes of construction. In their rural village, these women, whose jobs were to gather and grow food, understood the consequences of deforestation more so than the local men, who were employed by these woodcutters. But recently men have arrived to dominate fields of tangible production, and to lead industries of technological advancement— up-and-coming industries, of course, have an uncanny ability to draw men into their workforce. As a result, women’s traditional activist efforts are denigrated and fall to the frontburner as being merely emotion-driven appeals to sympathy, somehow losing validity as a result of their foundation in a personal connection to the issue.
            </p>
            <p>
                In the beginning of the twentieth century, an artificial canal, originally intended to connect the upper and lower Niagara Rivers, was bought by Hooker Chemical company, which spent thirty years dumping chemicals into it before burying it and selling it to the city for one dollar. A town, ironically named Love Canal, was built upon this purchased land, and  birth defects and miscarriages soon rose to an alarming prevalence among resident families. Taking matters into her own hands, a Love Canal resident named Lois Gibbs gathered an activist group composed primarily of working-class women, who were persistently dismissed as “hysterical housewives.”
            </p>
            <p>
                Did Gibbs not do a sufficient job gathering up testimonies and information to warrant that Hooker Chemical Company be investigated in relation to the toxicity of their neighborhood? Was she perhaps too personally invested in the case because her own previously healthy son had developed epilepsy and asthma—too biased, perhaps—to be considered as a real source of evidence to be taken seriously? Was her passion too strong, her rallies of fellow mothers too unprofessional, or her voice too shrill to be heard by the government officials? Or perhaps it was just that a male EPA who later became involved just had such a way with words that only he, armed with the hard facts and voice of detached reason, was able to persuade the New York Health Commissioner that Love Canal constituted an emergency situation.
            </p>
            <p>
                This is not to say that women have any more responsibility to the environment than men, or that women should ever feel obliged to fill traditional roles of caretaking and labors of reproduction, but to say that historically, this has been the case.  All of this frustrates me, not only because respect for and protection of the environment is an important and urgent and universal issue, but also because women shouldn’t have to relinquish their power and precedence for their pleas to finally be heard. Men’s involvement in environmental work is not, by itself, a bad thing—all people need to work to protect the earth. But men becoming involved in environmental work does pose a legitimate risk: that just as soon as they begin speaking on the benefits of profitable industries of conservation and impersonal political strategies, women will begin to be silenced. We must ensure that the work many women have been doing for centuries—the work of herbal medicines, of fostering respect for nature, of rallying mothers who see their children getting sick from chemicals leaching into their water supplies—does not need to be claimed by masculine powers that build and buy and profit to reap the benefits it deserves.
